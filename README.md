EventWriter is a tool meant to improve productivity for Project Sigma development.

> Description of Project Sigma can be simplified as "another discord bot", but it has its unique perks:
> It's meant to host an economic-political game, where each register server is a separate settlement.
> Each settlement starts as village but then grows, developed by actions of the users.
> Economy is free market based by default, but it can be changed according to will of the inhabitants.
> Proper diplomatic interactions and military interventions are also planned.

Developer uses it to create a structure of event, which later will be processed by the bot and displayed to user.
It should be remembered that EventWriter is WIP, and much of its functionality is yet to be implemented.
It gives some insight into code practises of the programmer though.
