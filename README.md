All right reserved unless otherwise specified. Processing allowed for recruitment purposes.

EventWriter is a tool meant to improve productivity for Project Sigma development.

> Description of Project Sigma can be simplified as "another discord bot", but it has its unique perks:
> It's meant to host an economic-political game, where each register server is a separate settlement.
> Each settlement starts as village but then grows, developed by actions of the users.
> Economy is free market based by default, but it can be changed according to will of the inhabitants.
> Proper diplomatic interactions and military interventions are also planned.

Developer uses it to create a structure of event, which later will be processed by the bot and displayed to user.
